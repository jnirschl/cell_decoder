------------------
## Introduction
The Cell DEep learning and COmputational DEscriptoR (DECODER) toolbox is an API, written in Python, for training and applying neural networks to biological datasets. Our goal is to provide an easy interface to models pre-trained on biological datasets to improve image analysis and phenotypic profiling in biology. It is currently built on the [Microsoft Cognitive Toolkit (CNTK)](https://github.com/Microsoft/CNTK), but can be extended to support other deep learning packages.

------------------
## Installation
Cell DECODER requires CNTK as a backend engine. Please follow the [CNTK installation instructions](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cognitive-toolkit/Setup-CNTK-on-your-machine).

Install from PyPi (todo)
```
sudo pip install cell_decoder
```
